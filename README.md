# Web3Task-contracts

This protocol aims to solve the problem of monetized contributions by fractionalizing work and demands just like the GitHub issues, where the company creates the issues and places a bounty for users to solve them under the company's terms.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the MVP stage. The following features will be implemented in the next versions:

- Bid
- Disputes
- Ranking
- Proxy
- Fee Mechanism
- Deployment for 3rd-parties (Multiple projects using the same contract to optimize front-end indexing)

if you are a developer and want to contribute to these features, don't hesitate to get in touch with us as we are still in the conception phase of them.

## Disputes

We are aware that disputes are common ground in this kind of service, so we are not mainly working on a solution to address this problem as a lot of people tried and failed. Instead, our solution is a gamified approach for both task creator and task assignee. Delivering prior to the date will harvest a better score for the assignee, while having its created tasks completed the task creator will also harvest the profile score. This score will be used to rank users in the platform, and the higher the score the more trustable the user is. Opening disputes are supposed to be a risky and unworthy move by both sides, as disputes will drastically decrease the score of both sides of the wrong side according to the DAO final saying.

## Bounties

The task creator will be able to create a task and set a bounty for it, and the task assignee will be able to start the task and submit it for review. If the task creator approves the task, the bounty will be sent to the task assignee, otherwise, the task creator will be able to cancel the task and get the bounty back.

## Ranking

The ranking system will be based on the score of the user, which will be calculated based on the following factors:

- Deliver time prior to the deadline
- Reward Amount
- Disputes during the execution of the task

The scores will only be applied after the task's final complitude.

## Features

Regarding Task management, the following features are implemented:

- Create
- Start
- Review
- Complete
- Cancel
- Edit Title
- Edit Description
- Edit Deadline
- Edit Metadata

Note that editing sensitive information that might affect the task assignee will not be allowed.

To manage the Access Control of users, the following methods are implemented:

- Set Role: Sets the role ID for an address as true,
- Set Operator: Sets which role it can manage the contract functions.

Note that every function in the contract must have a role ID assigned to operate it and an address authorized by a role ID.

## Contracts

- TaskManager: The main contract that manages the tasks.
- AccessControl: The contract that manages the access control of the users.
- Web3Task: The core implementation of the task marketplace.
- IW3Task: The interface of the Web3Task contract.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
npm i
```

## Setting Up A Stanrdad Formatting Code

1. Install the Prettier - Code Formatter in the VsCode extension with `esbenp.prettier-vscode`.

2. Modify the settings json.
   - 2.1. Press `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` to oppen the command pallets.
   - 2.2. Type "Open Settings (JSON)".
   - 2.3. Add the following lines to the JSON file:
   ```
   "[solidity]": {
   "editor.defaultFormatter": "NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity"
   },
       "[typescript]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
   }
   ```

## Setting Up Local Blockchain

Run a Hardhat node:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

The node will generate some accounts. You can realize they are already set at .env.sample, you should just let it be.

Add the first one to Metamask to be the leader and the second to be the member. The account will be:

```
0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
```

To add the localhost network to metamask, click on the network dropdown and select `Custom RPC`. Fill in the following fields:

- Network Name: `localhost`
- New RPC URL: `http://localhost:8545`
- Chain ID: `31337`
- Currency Symbol: `ETH`

> **_NOTE:_** Use the recommended accounts to avoid errors.

## Deploying Smart Contracts in the Localhost

Makefile will set everything for us, just run:

```bash
make mocks
```

## Livenet Deployment

Remove the `.sample` from the `.env.sample` file and fill in the values with the corresponding API from RPC providers.

## Usage

If you are not using livenet, you should comment chain configurations at `hardhat.config.ts` or mock the keys in the `.env` file, otherwise you will get an error from hardhat.

To run all the unitary tests, run:

## Address deployed to the Polygon Mainnet

POLYGON -> 0x37a9594B9741Cc5eE7Fd41C86Cc6C56B01d31e5A

## Address deployed to the Mumbai Testnet

MUMBAI -> 0xfcf05f746cb9e4643a2db20b80f94dda07693d39

```bash
yarn test
```
